## How to run:
In order to run the website, in the commandline select the path of the project (under the folder name 'TrustPilot).
In the commandline, run the following commands;

npm install --save firebase
npm install --save angularfire2 

And once these two files have been installed, the server can be run by running the following command (still in the path previously specified):

ng serve

The website is run on the localhost:4200. 

## What is the website?
This is a clone of the popular website Trustpilot, but with a limited set of features. These features focus primarily on the database and integration with Google's login API.
The website is constructed using the Typescript frontend framework Angular in combination with Google's Firebase backend.
The project was made in a team of 5 students during the course *Distribution and integration technologies*

## What did I learn?
* How to create a frontend using Angular's framework. 
* How to connect the frontend to a Firebase backend, where the noSQL database and Google login integration could be set up.
